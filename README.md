A Deep Learning model that generates descriptive captions for images. This project utilizes an **Encoder-Decoder architecture** with **Attention Mechanism**, combining **EfficientNet-B3** for visual feature extraction and an **LSTM** for text generation.

## 🌟 Project Overview

Image captioning requires a model to understand the visual content of an image and translate it into a natural language sentence. This project solves this using a CNN-RNN architecture enhanced with Bahdanau Attention to focus on specific image regions during caption generation.

### Key Features
* **Encoder:** Pre-trained **EfficientNet-B3** (frozen) for robust feature extraction.
* **Decoder:** **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) network to handle sequence generation.
* **Attention Mechanism:** "Soft" Attention (Bahdanau) allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the image for each word it generates.
* **Inference:** Implements **Beam Search** (k=3) for higher quality caption generation compared to standard greedy search.

## 🏗️ Architecture

1.  **Input Image:** resized to `(224, 224, 3)`.
2.  **Feature Extractor:** EfficientNet-B3 outputs a `14x14` grid of `1536` feature channels.
3.  **Attention Layer:** Computes a context vector based on the current LSTM state and image features.
4.  **Sequence Generator:** LSTM takes the context vector + previous word embedding to predict the next word.

## 📊 Dataset

* **Dataset Used:** [Flickr8k Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k)
* **Size:** 8,091 Images.
* **Vocab Size:** ~3,000 words (Threshold = 5).
* **Splits:** 80% Training, 20% Validation/Test.
